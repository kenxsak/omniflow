2. **Usage limits on free tier** → force upgrades
3. **"Coming Soon" for invoicing** → collect interest
4. **Transaction fee on existing payments** → passive income
5. **WhatsApp message credits** → usage-based billing

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Don't build features. Build revenue streams.**

Every feature should answer:
- "How do I charge for this?"
- "What data locks them in?"
- "Why will they open this daily?"

If it doesn't answer all 3, don't build it.
